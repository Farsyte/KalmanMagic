\section{Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization}

This procedure is used to generate a collection
of vectors that are orthogonal, when weighted by
a given vector, from an input collection of
vectors that are assumed to be linearly independent.

More formally stated,
given a collection of input vectors, $w_+ \dots w_n$,
each of dimension $N \ge n$,
and positive scalar weights $d_+ \dots d_N$
arranged along the diagonal of the matrix $D$,
generate a related set of vectors, $v_+ \dots v_n$,
such that $v_i^T D v_j$ is zero whenever $i \ne j$.

The Modified Weighted Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization
algorithm generates the results using the following equations,
using (\ref{mwgson}) to generate the highest numbered result
then working backward iteratively in decreasing $j$ order
using (\ref{mwgsoj}):
\begin{subequations}
\label{mwgso}
\begin{align}
  v_n & = w_n
\label{mwgson}
\\
  v_j &= w_j - \sum_{k = j + 1}^{n}{
  \left( \frac{w_j^t D v_k}{v_k^t D v_k} \right)
  v_k
  }, && j = n-1 \dots 1
\label{mwgsoj}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

See \verb|mwgso.m| for a Matlab implementation
of the above backward-recursive Modified Weighted
Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization.

This algorithm is useful when we have an equation
such as (\ref{mwgsomf}) where $W$ has too many columns
and $D$ is too large, and we want to obtain the $UDU^t$
factorization:
\begin{equation}
W D W^t
= \left({\bar U} V\right) D \left({\bar U} V\right)^t
= {\bar U} \left( V D V^t \right) {\bar U}^t
= {\bar U} {\bar D} {\bar U}^t
\label{mwgsomf}
\end{equation}
where $W$ is $n$ by $N$, $N \ge n$,
and $D$ is a diagonal matrix with $N$ entries;
and we require ${\bar U}$ to be unit upper triangular
of dimension $n$ by $n$,
and ${\bar D}$ to be diagonal and
of dimension $n$ by $n$.

Recovery of the value of ${\bar U}$
such that $W = {\bar U} V$
and construction of ${\bar D}$
is simple to insert into the algorithm:
\begin{subequations}
\label{mwgso_mf}
\begin{align}
  v_k & = w_k
\label{mwgso_mfi}
\\
  {\bar D}_j & = v_j^t D v_j
\label{mwgso_mfd}
\\
  {\bar U}_{kj} & = v_k^t D v_j / {\bar D}_j
\label{mwgso_mfu}
\\
  v_k & = v_k - {\bar U}_{kj} v_j
\label{mwgso_mfv}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Equation (\ref{mwgso_mfi}) is executed once
at the start for all $k = 1 \dots n$.
Then we iterate through the remainder of the equations
for $j = n-1 \dots 1$.
Equations (\ref{mwgso_mfu}) and (\ref{mwgso_mfv})
are executed for $k = 1 \dots j-1$
where the last equation updates $v_k$ in place.
While this algorithm does not set them,
we implicitly have ${\bar U}_{ii} = 1$
and ${\bar U}_{ij} = 0$ when $i>j$
giving us our desired unit upper triangular ${\bar U}$.

See \verb|mwgso_mf.m| for a Matlab implementation
of the above backward-recursive Modified Weighted
Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization
producing a Matrix Factorization of the result.
