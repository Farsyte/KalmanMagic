\section{Agee-Turner PD Factorzation Update}

This procedure is used to update a positive definite matrix
when it is being incremented by another matrix of a
very specific form, as follows:
\begin{align}
  {\bar U} {\bar D} {\bar U}^t
  & = U D U^t + c a a^t
\label{udutcaat}
\end{align}
where
$U$ and ${\bar U}$ are unit upper triangular,
$D$ and ${\bar D}$ are diagonal,
$c$ is a positive scalar,
and $a$ is a vector;
the purpose of the update is to calculate
${\bar U}$ and ${\bar D}$
when given $U$, $D$, $c$ and $a$.
The algorithm to accomplish this is as follows:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  {\bar D}_j & = D_j + c a_j^2
\label{udutcaatdj}
\\
  a_k & = a_k - a_j U_{kj}
\label{udutcaatak}
\\
  {\bar U}_{kj} & = U_{kj} + c a_j a_k / {\bar D}_j
\label{udutcaatu}
\\
  c & = c d_j / {\bar D}_j
\label{udutcaatc}
\\
  {\bar D}_1 & = D_1 + c a_1^2
\label{udutcaatd1}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Equations
(\ref{udutcaatdj}),
(\ref{udutcaatak}),
(\ref{udutcaatu}) and
(\ref{udutcaatc})
are executed in sequence
for each value of $j = n \dots 2$;
within this loop,
equations
(\ref{udutcaatak}) and
(\ref{udutcaatu})
are executed for values of $k = 1 \dots j-1$.
Note that equation
(\ref{udutcaatc})
modifies the value of $c$.
Finally,
(\ref{udutcaatd1})
is executed to complete the result.

See \verb|udut_caat.m|
for a Matlab implementation.
