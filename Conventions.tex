\section{Typographical Conventions}

\subsection{Symbols}

Typically, upper case will refer to matrix quantities;
vectors and scalars will use lower case.
A certain level of comfort with Greek letters
is freely assumed.

\begin{tabular}{cl}
   {\it Symbol} & {\it Usage}
\\ $D$          & diagonal factor of error covariance,
                        $U D U^t = P$
\\              & ($D$ is also a generic diagonal in support code)
\\ $F$          & state transition matrix,
                        $y = F x$
\\ $H$          & observation coefficients
\\ $I$          & identity matrix (of size appropriate to context)
\\ $K$          & Kalman Gain
\\ $N(\mu,V)$   & Normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and covariance $V$
\\ $P$          & covariance of error of state estimate
\\ $Q$          & covariance of process noise
\\ $Q_d$        & a factor of process noise,
                        $S_q Q_d S_q^t = Q$
\\ $R$          & covariance of observation noise
\\ $S$          & square root of error covariance,
                        $S S^t = P$
\\ $S_q$        & a factor of system noise,
                        $S_r Q_d S_r^t = Q$
\\ $S_r$        & square root of observation noise,
                        $S_r S_r^t = R$
\\ $U$          & unit upper triangular factor of error covariance,
                        $U D U^t = P$
\\ $x$          & current system state vector
\\ $y$          & state vector after a time step
\\ $z$          & vector of observations
\\ $I_m$        & information matrix,
                        elsewhere known as $\Lambda$
\\ $I_v$        & information vector,
                        elsewhere known as $\delta$
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Decorations}

\begin{tabular}{cl}
   {\it Symbol} & {\it Usage}
\\ $A^t$        & transpose of $A$
\\ $A^{-1}$     & inverse of $A$
\\ $A^{-t}$     & transpose of inverse of $A$
\\ ${\tilde a}$ & predicted value of $a$
\\ ${\hat a}$   & filtered value of $a$
\\ ${\bar a}$   & alternate value of $a$,
                        often ``normalized''
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Oddities}

Notation previously used to distinguish
symbols relating to ``after a time step''
from those relating to ``at the current time''
had the tendency to obscure,
rather than expose.
The symbol $y$ is now used to represent
the state of the system after a time step;
the intent of the few remaining actual ambiguities
should be clear from context.
